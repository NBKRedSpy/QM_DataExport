[h1]Quasimorph QM_DataExport[/h1]


Extracts the game's config_* data to the app data folder.

The data can be found at [i]%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Magnum Scriptum Ltd\Quasimorph\QM_DataExport\Data[/i]. with the extension of .tsv.

The data is extracted directly from the game's resources.  The files often contain more than one table, with each table being preceded by a #<table name>.

The item id's generally do not match the name displayed in the game, so the user will need to find the actual item ids themselves.

Unfortunately, I will not assist in finding the ids in the files for users.
