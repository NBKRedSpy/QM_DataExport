[b][size=5]Quasimorph Data Export[/size][/b] 
 
 
Extracts the game's config_* data to the app data folder.
 
The data can be found at [font=Courier New]%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Magnum Scriptum Ltd\Quasimorph\QM_DataExport\Data[/font]. with the extension of .tsv.
 
The data is extracted directly from the game's resources.  The files often contain more than one table, with each table being preceded by a #<table name>.
 
The item ids generally do not match the name displayed in the game, so the user will need to find the actual item ids themselves.

Unfortunately, I will not assist in finding the ids in the files for users.
